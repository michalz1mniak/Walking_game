# Walking Game

**Walking Game** is a lightweight 2D side-scrolling platformer developed in Python using the Pygame and Pymunk libraries. The player controls a character by independently moving each of their limbs, using physics-based interaction provided by Pymunk.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- pygame  
- pymunk

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pygame pymunk
```
